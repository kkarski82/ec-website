  1: And we meet again...
  2: >
     4 years have passed since the last European Championship held in Warsaw and
     even in our wildest dreams we didn't think that we'll get another chance to
     accomodate players from entire Europe (and not just that) in such short time.
     In 2011 we have organized a tournament, which ended up being a great success
     in terms of organization and attendance (we're not bragging - we were being
     praised). Despite all the effort it cost us and many sleepless nights, very
     quickly we wanted a "repeat of the fun" (to quote classic Polish audition)
     and here it is. European Championship 2015 in Poland.
  3: >
     We're fully aware that it isn't easy to organize a tournament of such scale
     and gather enough players in those hard times for VTES - many of us reminisce
     the days, when tournaments of this rank gathered almost two hundred players.
  4: >
     Well, we live in a world of dreams which should be realized; that's why our
     first thought was "why not?". Why not organize the biggest tournament in
     years? Why not count on attendance getting close to the magic 200 people?
     Why not go out of the usual bounds and prepare something extra? Something outside
     of the usual programme and surprising? Asking those questions to ourselves
     we've decided it's worth a try.
  5: >
     This website is meant to make it easier for you to make a decision - to come
     or not to come? You'll learn everything about the tournament here: hotel
     prices, costs, parties, prizes etc. Information will be added to the website
     as soon as we confirm it.
  6: >
     We believe that the effort extended so far, and things we want to prepare
     for you will make it so that you'll decide to spend the end of September
     in hot Warsaw, playing your favourite game in an excellent company of friends
     and rivals. That's what we wish upon you and ourselves.
